# üìö Description

OpenMEP Package also includes a comprehensive library of MEP components, making it easy to select and incorporate the
right components into your design.This library includes a wide range of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components,
including pipes, fittings, valves, ducts, electrical equipment, and more fully automate your design process in design,
maintenance, calculation and analysis,...

I believe that the MEP Package will be a valuable asset to construction professionals looking to streamline the MEP
design process and ensure that their projects are completed on time and within budget.
