/// <summary>
///    An element that represents a custom family (not a system family) in Autodesk Revit.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///    Custom families within the Revit API represented by three objects - Family, <see cref="T:Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilySymbol" />
///    and <see cref="T:Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilyInstance" />.
///    Each object plays a significant part in the structure of families. The Family element represents the entire family
///    that consists of a collection of types, such as an 'I Beam'. You can think of that object as representing the entire
///    family file. The Family object contains a number of <see cref="T:Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilySymbol" /> elements. The
///    <see cref="T:Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilySymbol" /> object represents a specific set
///    of family settings within that Family and represents what is known in the Revit user interface as a
///    Type, such as 'W14x32'. The <see cref="T:Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilyInstance" /> object represents an actual instance of that
///    type placed the Autodesk Revit project. For example the <see cref="T:Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilyInstance" /> would
///    be a single instance of a W14x32 column within the project.
